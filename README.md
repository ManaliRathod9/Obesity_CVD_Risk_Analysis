# **Obesity and CVD Risk Analysis**

This project focuses on understanding the factors that contribute to obesity and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risks using machine learning. It covers everything from cleaning and exploring data to creating models that predict health risks. The goal is to learn more about the data and build reliable models that can help identify these risks early.

# **Dataset**

The dataset used for this project is called **Obesity or CVD Risk Dataset**, which is available on Kaggle. It contains 2,111 records with 17 attributes, including details like age, weight, height, physical activity, and eating habits.

# **Tools and Libraries**

To complete this project, the following tools and libraries were used:

- **Python:** The programming language for this project.
- **Pandas and NumPy:** For handling and analyzing the dataset.
- **Scikit-learn:** For building machine learning models like Linear Regression, Ridge, and Lasso.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn:** For creating clear and informative visualizations.

# **Project Highlights**

### **Data Cleaning and Exploration**
- Cleaned the dataset to remove missing or unnecessary values.
- Analyzed relationships between different factors, such as age, weight, and physical activity.

### **Data Visualization**
- Created graphs to show patterns and trends in the data, including heatmaps and histograms.
- Explored correlations between factors like height and weight to better understand the dataset.

### **Machine Learning Models**
- Built and tested models to predict health risks using methods like Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet.
- Applied regularization techniques to enhance model accuracy and avoid overfitting.

### **Results and Insights**
- Successfully predicted obesity and CVD risks based on the dataset.
- Identified and analyzed key factors influencing health risks.
